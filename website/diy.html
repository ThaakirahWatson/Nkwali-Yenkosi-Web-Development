        <p>Leather jackets and bags are timeless fashion pieces that can last for years with the right care.
            Proper maintenance ensures they stay in top condition, looking stylish and preserving their quality.
            Here are some essential DIY methods to keep your leather jackets and bags in great shape:</p>
        
        <h2>Caring for Your Leather Jackets and Bags</h2>
        <h1>1. Cleaning:</h1>
        <li>Begin by dusting your leather items with a soft, dry cloth to remove loose dirt and debris.</li>
        <li>For deeper cleaning, make a mild soap solution using a few drops of gentle leather cleaner or a mixture of mild soap and warm water.</li>
        <li>Dampen a clean cloth in the solution and gently wipe the surface of your leather items.</li>
        <li>Wipe off any soap residue with a clean, damp cloth and pat dry with another cloth.</li>
        <li>Allow your leather items to air dry naturally, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.</li>

        <h1>2. Conditioning:</h1>
        <li>Leather can lose its natural oils over time, making it dry and susceptible to cracking. Regular conditioning helps restore moisture and maintains its suppleness.</li>
        <li>Use a leather conditioner or cream that is specifically designed for your type of leather.</li>
        <li>Apply a small amount of conditioner to a clean, dry cloth and rub it into the leather in a circular motion.</li>
        <li>Let the conditioner soak in for a few hours or as directed on the product label.</li>
        <li>Buff the leather with a clean cloth to remove any excess conditioner.</li>

        <li>To prevent stains and damage, consider applying a leather protector or waterproofing spray.</li>
        <li>Apply the protector in a well-ventilated area, following the product's instructions.</li>
        <li>Allow it to dry completely before using your leather items.</li>

        <li>Store your leather jackets and bags in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.</li>
        <li>Use breathable storage bags or dust covers to protect them from dust and moisture.</li>
        <li>Avoid hanging leather items for long periods, as it can lead to stretching or misshaping. Instead, store them flat or upright.</li>
